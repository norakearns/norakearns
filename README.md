### About Me :
I am a highly motivated bioinformatician excited about creating tools to accelerate research and discovery. I enjoy working at the intersection of biology, engineering, and data science, and thrive on goal-oriented cross-functional teams. My specific interests include pipeline development, processing, analysis, and visualization of sequencing data from high-throughput screening assays. I also have two years of teaching/tutoring experience, and love creating stories from data and presenting technical information in a meaningful way. Demonstrated proficiency in Python, Bash, and R, as well as Nextflow and Snakemake workflow managers.
